## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The name comes from my interests in artisanal crafts and making hands on practical stuff. In earlier days in the rural area of the Netherlands where i'm from, you were often asked: "Where are you from?". Rather than an actual place, it referred to: "Who are your parents or grandparents. And for clarification a location, house name or occupation was added. In my case "Van de SchÃªper", as the farmhouse was called where my father and grandfather were raised.

Here I hope to get used to documenting my projects and combining artisanal and digital techniques in nice projects. I am a biomedical engineer by education, have worked as mechanical engineer and am currently involved at FabLab Oldenzaal.
